        <h3>COMPANY HISTORY</h3>
          <p>What do you get when you combine a mechanical engineer and Harvard MBA with an online marketing guru? 
            An online marketing engine capable of growing businesses—fast. Blue Corona was founded in 2007 by Ben 
            Landers with the help of Bob Perini. Bob founded DrinkMore Water, a two-time Inc. 500 company and the 
            largest privately owned bottled water delivery company in the Mid-Atlantic region serving homes and
            offices. While working as Bob’s Vice President of Sales and Marketing, Ben helped Bob create a system 
            to accurately track and quantify every single advertising campaign and marketing campaign employed by 
            DrinkMore (including the website). Being a numbers guy, Bob knew that data combined with gut intuition
            would allow him to outperform business owners operating on gut intuition alone. It worked. 
            Today, DrinkMore Water continues to be one of the most successful locally owned bottled water delivery 
            companies in the country.</p>
            <br />
          <p>
            If Bob’s contribution to Blue Corona was a framework for analyzing businesses and using data to optimize
            them, Ben’s contribution was to use the web to supercharge their growth. With Bob’s support and buy-in, 
            Ben transformed DrinkMore Water into an Internet marketing powerhouse. Using data derived from what is 
            now Blue Corona’s marketing analytics platform, Bob eliminated nearly $150,000 in (ineffective) Yellow 
            Page print ads per year. A fraction of this money was used by Ben to convert DrinkMore’s website from a 
            “brochure-type” site into a fully optimized lead generation machine with an e-commerce component. Online 
            marketing strategies like SEO, PPC and Email represent DrinkMore’s top marketing strategies – generating
            more leads than every other marketing strategy combined.

        <h3>OUR MISSION</h3>   
          <p>
            At Blue Corona, we have a single goal: Help business owners and marketing executives use technology and 
            the Internet to measurably improve their marketing performance and ROI. This starts by accurately 
            tracking every single advertising strategy – even if your only strategy is your company website. Tracking
            will provide you with never-before-seen insights about your business and will change the way you look at 
            advertising and marketing forever. The data derived from tracking and the insights provided by Blue Corona
            will allow you to eliminate ineffective advertising strategies and to quickly identify new marketing 
            strategies that have the potential to help you cost-effectively grow your business. You’ll also see 
            opportunities to get more output from strategies you already have – like your website. Blue Corona has helped
            dozens of companies double, triple and even quadruple their website’s visit-to-lead conversion rates.

        <h3>INDUSTRIES WE SERVE</h3>  
          <p>
            Although nearly any type of business can leverage the Internet as a sales and marketing tool and benefit
            from accurate ad tracking and marketing measurement, business-to-consumer service-type businesses seem to
            benefit the most. Currently, Blue Corona’s clients come from almost every B2C service industry – from clean
            energy and solar panels to roofing companies and HVAC. We have numerous bottled water delivery companies and
            several large plumbing companies. If you invest in advertising OR have a website, Blue Corona can almost 
            certainly help you measurably increase your performance.
